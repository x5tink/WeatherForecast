# WeatherForecast


This application was created to demonstrate simple react usage, mvc .net and use of a restful API. Its fairly basic and completed over a short period of time for demonstration purposes. 
 It uses a standard visual studio mvc react template, which includes an authorised user function. You will need a login to reach the weather page. (doesn't have to be a real address mind you)
Code wise, almost all of the changes were in MetaWeatherForecastController.cs, MetaWeatherForecast.cs and WeatherForecast.js.
