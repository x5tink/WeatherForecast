# WeatherForecast


This application was created to demonstrate simple react usage, mvc .net and use of a restful API. Its fairly basic and completed over a short period of time for demonstration purposes. 
 It uses a standard visual studio mvc react template, which includes an authorised user function. You will need a login to reach the weather page. (doesn't have to be a real address mind you)
Code wise, almost all of the changes were in MetaWeatherForecastController.cs, MetaWeatherForecast.cs and WeatherForecast.js. 

Apologies, this is the first time i've created my own github project myself, so the layout may be a bit messed up, or i missed a setting.
